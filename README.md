### Hello! ðŸ‘‹


Hello, my name is Benjamin Costerton.

Most things I get up to are to do with sound, be it engineering, thinking about it, or just listening.

I am a broadcast audio network engineer most days doing what I can to make things talk to each other while sounding nice.

Right now Iâ€™m working in television, and based in London.
